//basic funcitonality of jsx is that only one element can re returned in a function
//lets create a new jsx file and return it in this app.jsx (hello.jsx)
// we will also need to import that file in this app.jsx
//one more rule of jsx is that the name of function must have the first letter capital.

//to run more elements in single return statement use <div> or just <> (fragment)
